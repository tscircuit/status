Status checks for tscircuit internal services.

Runs every 10 minutes using github workflows.

Every time it runs it appends the status check results to `statuses.jsonl` (limiting to
2 weeks of logs)

Each service has a specific method to check it, see [./service-checks](./service-checks)

You may need particular auth environment variables to run the checks.
